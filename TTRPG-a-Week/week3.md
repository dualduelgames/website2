## Quick Story Idea


**Spoiler Alert!**

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Click here to view Story Details</summary>

Alien artifact found in a forest. Someone has been investigating it for a few weeks.

They have been augmented by the artifact and have moved their consciousness into other bodies, but can't go back into a body they have already been in. They start to cause problems in the forest hoping that someone will come investigate and they can try to take over that body. They are currently in the body of a buff outdoorsman who stumbled across the experiments.

Not every body will work for every mind. So some people have gone missing from this guy trying and failing to get into bodies. He also experimented on some other people before he tried it on himself. So now there are some human minds stuck in animal bodies running around, causing problems for the local town.

Done poorly the mind goes insane, done ok the mind is moved, and done well the mind is enhanced and moved. But no matter what, it cannot return to a body it has previously been in.

### Introduction:

Reports of weird animal behaviour and missing people have led to government investigators, journalists, and conspiracy theorists showing up to the small town.

### Part 1: Rumours in Town

**Players can find out:**

- [ ] Strange lights in the sky one night 2 years ago. Over the woods. No one could determine what it was.  
- [ ] The wife of a missing person came home to find a deer in her house. It didn’t run away when she showed up, she had to threaten it. The deer seems to have broken a window to get in but didn’t damage anything else. The local sheriff thinks it was a prank by some teens.  
- [ ] The town used to have a sawmill in the forest, but it went out of business 6 years ago. There were some tax issues with the business and it was shut down by the government.  
- [ ] A smart wolf has been harassing a household on the edge of town. It seems to know what a gun is and stays behind cover until it can get closer. It even seems to be able to count the number of shots taken and knows when a rifle needs to be reloaded. The local sheriff thinks the guy was just imagining things from his fear.  
- [ ] Someone claims they saw a mountain lion carrying a jerry can away from a garage. The dead body of a mountain lion was found in the forest a few days later.  
- [ ] A man visiting from another city, went into the forest a couple weeks ago to camp and hunt. But he has not been seen since.

**Red Herrings:**

- [ ] Several children went missing in the woods 20 years ago and were never found.  
- [ ] The principal is having an affair with the librarian.  
- [ ] The ghost of an early settler haunts the town every June 1st.  
- [ ] School kids claim that if you walk into the forest at night while holding a jar of peanut butter, you will disappear and never be seen again. This rumour has been around for decades.

### Part 2: Forest Encounters

If players go out into the woods to look for animals, they might find normal animals or ones that seem to have gone crazy. (Roll D6, or choose)

1. Normal Deer \- behaves normally, will run away if you don’t fully sneak up on it.  
2. Same as above but two of them.   
3. Normal Wolf \- behaves normally, will growl and defend itself, but tries to stay away from humans.  
4. Dead deer \- looks like it was killed by a wolf.  
5. The “Smart” wolf will try to attack the players by sneaking up on them. It knows to avoid the line of sight of anyone with a gun. Will run away if things get too dangerous.   
6. The “Smart” deer will put itself at risk to try to get the players to follow it to a clearing, where a piece of tattered clothing can be found. Taking it back to town, it is revealed that it belonged to a person who went missing.

### Part 3: Shocking Discovery

Players return to town to further investigate. The sheriff gets reports of several bodies being found outside town. They include several of the missing people, along with several dead animals.  
Investigating the area shows tire tracks heading into the forest using an old logging road. The town is on lock down, with people afraid to leave their homes. The sheriff asks the players to investigate, so he can stay and keep the town safe.

If the players investigate the bodies, they find that they died some time ago. No signs of what killed them. The dead animals are also without any marks or injuries.

Following the logging road, the players will encounter a couple other “crazy” animals. But they will eventually arrive at the old sawmill area.

### Part 4: Sawmill Crash Site

**Crater**  
A large crater lies 200 feet from the old sawmill. From the looks of the plants around it, the impact must have been a couple years ago. Plants in the area have regrown, but they do seem to be oddly shaped, with weird leaves or snaking branches.  
A track shows that a large object was dragged from the crater, probably using a truck. The tracks lead to the main building of the sawmill. You can see that several trees were cut to create a path for the truck to drag it.

**Sawmill**  
Surprisingly there does still seem to be power to the building. There is a noise in the distance that could be a gas generator.   

### Part 5: Confrontation

**Villain’s Lab**  
The main room of the sawmill has been converted into a mad scientist’s lab. Cables run across the floor. Buzzing electrical panels line the walls. A large alien device takes up the center of the room. It has two chambers, one on each side. The dead bodies of a few animals lie to the side. There are clear signs that human bodies were dragged away, leaving trails of blood.

Notes on the desk were written by someone named Johnathan. It lists several attempts to use the device on local animals and people who were kidnapped. The notes include ideas on how to make sure he can use the device on himself without risk. The last entry states that the process was successful and his mind has been enhanced.

**The Players’ Plan**  
Players could kill him, try to get him back in his original body or find a new body for him. The device could be destroyed or turned over to the authorities. They could also try to move themselves into new bodies, if they want to try to enhance themselves. 

**Villain’s Mind in a Hunter’s Body**  
SP: 13  Armour: 1  
Body: 3   Mind: 3  
Skills: athletics, close-quarters, chemistry, biology, aliens, electronics  
Gear: thick jacket, knife (1D6 damage)

**Using the Device**  
The mind of one creature can be swapped with the mind of another. There is a 25% chance the body is not compatible and dies. A 50% chance that they are swapped successfully. And a 25% chance that they are swapped and “enhanced”.

A creature that is enhanced by the device gets \+1 to their body and mind stats, and gets \+2 to their max SP. Also their mind stat and skills move with them from body to body.
