# TTRPG-a-Week - Week 5

# Diabolical Darkness (For Shadowdark RPG)

Here is a quick primer for playing a game of Shadowdark inspired by the first Diablo computer game. I didn't copy it directly, so elements have been changed. But it should give a similar feel.

# Town History

A small town built next to the ruins of an ancient structure. Becomes famous when it is discovered that the waters pouring out of a statue can heal any disease. The town grows a bit from all the visitors it gets.
Then, a few years later, the water stops flowing. And tourism stops. People discover an entrance to an underground dungeon below the ruins. Trying to find the source of the healing waters, some brave people enter the dungeon, but are quickly pushed back by the monsters found within.
They do find some treasure. So now the town sometimes gets visitors from treasure hunters. The few townsfolk who haven't moved elsewhere eek out a meager living from selling supplies to the adventurers who show up.

# Healing Water

The waters that used to drip out of the statue in the ruins had a magic property for 24 hours after they came out. They would heal anyone who drank them to full health and remove any curses or diseases. Would not replace missing limbs but quickly healed open wounds.

# Stone Circle

On the edge of town there is a circle of ancient stones. No one knows what their original purpose was. They have arcane runes and symbols carved into them.

---

# Townsfolk

## Blacksmith

Long ago he came to heal his daughter's curse using the water. But he now lives here, even after his daughter grew up and left.

## Witch

Lives on the outskirts of town and brews and sells potions. She mostly makes a living selling healing potions, trying to go back to the days when she could easily sell bottles of the healing water (leaving out the detail of the magic wearing off after 24 hours).

## Sage

They live in town, and can read strange writings. Knows the history of the town.  
Can identify the properties of magic items, for a price.

## Innkeeper

Runs a small inn for travelers to stay in. Knows some healing magic and follows a god.

## Sick Orphan

Their parents died trying to find the healing waters underground. The townsfolk have taken pity on him. Sells items to travelers, but everything he sells is very unusual in some way.

# Items

## Mana Potions

Each potion restores a single lost spell of tier 1. Also the potions are quite rare. This prevents it from breaking the game's balance. That is also why it only restores a tier 1 spell.

---

## Variable Item Names

Give other names for common items to create more variety. Doesn’t change mechanics. Up to the GM, but they should allow a character who gets a bonus to one type of weapon to also get the bonus for the alternate named weapons (otherwise players will be unlikely to use the weapons they find).

## Magic Item Properties

To create a magic item, refer to the Magic Item section of the Shadowdark rulebook. Giving the players too many magic items will change game balance and may require the GM to increase combat difficulty.

# Dungeon

**First Levels**
The first few levels of the dungeon below the ruins appear to be man-made. They are carved stone with statues and burial chambers. Running along the ceiling is the copper pipe that used to bring the healing waters up to the surface. The pipe is cracked in several places but no water leaks out. The water isn't making up to the level. Enemies are few in number, but seem to respawn when the player's leave and then come back.

**Next Levels**
The next few levels become caves and roughly carved tunnels. The remains of other adventurers can be found in rooms. Signs of larger beasts can be found on the walls and corpses.

**Deeper Levels**
Players find a teleportation circle that can be used to return to the surface. Something large and loud stalks the caves this deep. The copper pipes can still occasionally be seen running along the walls.

# Where is the Water?

I am leaving it up to the GM to decide where the healing water comes from. And how the players can restore it.

It could be that there is a rift to another world and the water flows out of the rift. It could be that an huge ancient being is under the ground and it produces the water in some way. It could even be an arcane machine deep underground, built by a lich trying to achieve immortality.
