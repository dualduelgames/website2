# TTRPG-a-Week - Week 4

I took a week off.

# Tiny Glade (available on steam)

Took a week off. Spent some time playing around with [Tiny Glade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/) on steam.
It is an amzing tool for making small towns and castles for TTRPGs.
The export function isn't designed for that use, but it can work.

# Interobang Images

I generated some AI images for the Interobang rules system I wrote. I am hoping to use them to run a test session of the game.
