# TTRPG-a-Week - Week 2

For the second week of 2026, I created a rule system for an alternate history RPG.
Inspired by X-files, Twilight Zone, the Outer Limits, and Stargate SG1.
This is part one of the rules, next week will have the [second half](/interobang2).

# Interobang ‽ (part 1)


The year is 2000 but not the one history promised.

In the 1990s, governments across the world were quietly infiltrated by beings from another world. For years, they steered nations from the shadows, reshaping policies, alliances, and wars. Some countries were pushed toward peace. Others toward conflict. When the conspiracy was finally exposed, it didn’t end quietly. Entire cities were erased in the fighting, and every satellite in orbit was destroyed.

Humanity survived but society will never be the same.

Governments collapsed and were rebuilt. New government agencies were formed to hunt infiltrators and contain what was left behind. Trust became a rare resource. Some regions are still little more than wastelands, scarred by battles no one was ever meant to survive.

Though the invasion failed, it was not undone. Aliens still hide among humanity. No one can be certain who is real, who is watching, and who is waiting.

Fragments of alien technology further changed the world. Some sciences leapt forward through reverse engineering, while others were smothered by secrecy and fear. Surveillance is everywhere. Innovation is dangerous. There are rumors of inventors who simply vanish before their inventions can be fully developed.

The internet was pulled back under military and academic control. Long-life batteries exist, but only for those who can afford them. Wireless communication is widely distrusted. Cell phones are fading, replaced by landlines. Fax machines and hard copies replacing email and digital files. Paper maps, floppy disks, cassettes, and VHS tapes remain the standard.

Televisions are heavier than ever, but clearer. Alien technologies allow CRT screens to display high-definition images. Alien polymers allow VHS tapes to hold hours of pristine audio and video, preventing the introduction of new formats.

In the shadows, new beliefs grow. Alien worshipping cults spread across ruined cities and quiet towns alike. Conspiracies are no longer dismissed as nonsense.

This is a world that found the truth… and is still trying to survive it.

## Basic Rules

### Avoiding Danger:

When a character is threatened by danger, they make a Saving Throw. Roll 2d6 and add the appropriate stat (Body for physical risks or Mind for mental ones). If the total is **10** or higher, they avoid the danger.

### Doing Stuff:

When a player wants their character to attempt an action, they first check their skills. If they have a relevant skill and explain how it applies, the action succeeds automatically (no roll required). 
 
If they lack a suitable skill, or if the action must be done under extreme time pressure, they can still attempt it. In that case it comes down to luck. They roll 2d6 with no modifiers and try to beat **7**. Whether they succeed depends entirely on the roll.

### Taking Hits:

Characters have Stress Protection (SP), which soaks up all incoming harm (both physical and mental). Damage is applied to SP first. If an attack deals more damage than your remaining SP, any excess carries over and is applied directly to a stat (based on the type of harm).

Armour reduces incoming damage before it is applied to SP.

SP is easy to recover: a short rest is enough to restore it.  
Damage to stats is far more serious: healing that kind of harm requires days of safe, uninterrupted rest.

If a character’s Body stat is reduced to 0, they die. If their Mind stat is reduced to 0, their personality collapses and they go permanently insane.

Most enemies don’t track stats at all, when they lose all their SP, they die.

A typical character starts with a maximum of **12 SP**.

### Hitting Things:

Attacks automatically hit. Instead, you roll to see how much damage they deal. That damage is reduced by the target’s armour (if any), unless the attack is marked as piercing, in which case armour is ignored.

Light weapons deal 1d6 damage. Heavy weapons deal 2d6 damage. Ongoing effects like fire, poison, or bleeding usually deal 1 damage per turn, and this damage is typically piercing.

When weapon scale matters, apply these modifiers: weapons meant for people deal half damage to vehicles or structures, while weapons built to fight vehicles deal triple damage to people. The modifiers happen before applying armour.

### Reloading Weapons:

Ammunition is tracked abstractly using “reloads” instead of tracking bullets. Each weapon has an Ammo Rating (usually between 4 and 10\) that represents its magazine size, accuracy, and rate of fire all at once.

After any scene in which a weapon is used, the player rolls 2d6. If the result is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Ammo Rating, the weapon runs dry and must spend one “reload” before it can be used again. If the roll is higher than the Ammo Rating, there’s still ammo left and the weapon can keep firing.

## Skills

Skills represent the kinds of things a character has practical experience with.  It doesn't mean they are experts in that field, only that they have spent time learning it.

## Actions

Actions can occur on a moment by moment basis, or in more general roleplaying turns.
In some scenes, a single move might carry you across an entire neighborhood; in others, that same move only gets you across a room. The scale of time and distance is always set by the scene.
On your turn, you can take two actions, then play passes to the next character.

**Move** \- Move within your current location.  
**Move x2** \- Move from one location to another.  
**Attack** \- Use a weapon against a target in range.  
**Attack x2** \- Attack and get \+2 to the damage roll.  
**Dodge** \- Prepare for danger, gain \+1 to a stat or to your armour until your next turn.  
**Help** \- Set someone else up to succeed, letting them use your skill.  
**Interact** \- Use an object, speak, manipulate something, or otherwise engage with the scene.

## Index Cards

Use index cards to represent locations and important NPCs on the table. This helps everyone clearly see where characters are and how scenes are laid out. Players are encouraged to write notes directly on the cards to record details, changes, or discoveries so important information isn’t forgotten later.

## Connections

Characters have ties to people and organizations in the world. These connections can provide access to skills the character doesn’t have, or equipment they can’t easily get on their own. However, connections aren’t free. They require effort, favors, or upkeep from the players to keep them active and willing to help.

**Tech Startup Scene**  
You move in circles with programmers, hardware tinkerers, and garage inventors. You can use this connection to analyze software or electronics, learn about cutting-edge tech, or get access to prototype devices and makeshift labs.

**Research Lab**  
You have ties to scientists and engineers. This connection can help with biology, chemistry, physics, geology, and more. They may grant access to labs, specialized tools, or massive equipment like telescopes or particle accelerators.

**University**  
You know professors, administrators, and grad students. They can help with research, data analysis, or obscure knowledge. They might provide access to campus facilities, student labor, or a quiet place to hide in the dorms.

**Newsroom**  
You work with reporters, editors, and camera crews. This connection can dig up archives, verify photos or videos, and shape public narratives. They may offer access to cameras, editing suites, or even hide coded messages in print or broadcast media.

**Old Money**  
You are part of, or work for, a wealthy family with deep roots. You can borrow cars, use vacation homes, or call in favors from powerful friends. You can use this connection to get access to expensive things or to get an audience with powerful people.

**Military Circles**  
You know soldiers, officers, or defense contractors. They can provide gear, vehicles, intel, or quiet passage into restricted zones. You might be a veteran, contractor, or someone with the right contacts.

**Secret Society**  
You are part of a secret society, but you are nowhere near the top of the organization. You can sometimes gain access to influential figures, secret meetings, or forbidden knowledge. But there is always a cost. 

**Law Enforcement**  
You have ties to police, private security, or national agencies. They can help track suspects, access case files, speak to prisoners, or get you past barricades. They might also expect favors in return.

**Politicians**  
You work with politicians, staffers, or party officials. This connection can open government records, arrange meetings with department heads, or secure funding and office space.

**Fringe Investigators**  
You work with conspiracy theorists, pirate radio hosts, and underground “journalists.” They know rumors before anyone else and collect evidence of wildly mixed quality. Sometimes they’re wrong, but sometimes they’re terrifyingly right.

**Activists & Agitators**  
You know protestors, labor unions, hackers, or counter-culture groups. They can organize crowds, forge papers, sabotage systems, or hide you. They expect loyalty to the cause.

**Craftsmen**  
You work with mechanics, builders, welders, and technicians. They can get you tools, repairs, machinery, and access to job sites. Often the jobs sites include the homes and offices of powerful people.

**Telecom & Utilities**  
You know people who run phone lines, power grids, and cable networks. They can tap calls, kill cameras, fake outages, or get you into infrastructure tunnels.

**Entertainment Industry**  
You know musicians, actors, producers, or road crews. They can get you backstage access, fake credentials, or cover stories using tours, shows, and filming.

**Organized Crime**  
You have ties to smugglers, fixers, and underground markets. They can move illegal goods, erase problems, or find things no one admits exist.

**Shipping & Freight**  
You know dockworkers, truckers, and warehouse bosses. They can hide cargo, reroute shipments, or track mysterious packages.

**Medical System**  
You know doctors, nurses, or hospital admins. They can treat injuries quietly, alter records, or help study strange biology.

**Religious Circles**  
You’re tied to churches, cults, or spiritual movements. They can hide people, move quietly through communities, or spread messages fast.
