# Magic Gemstones
**By Ryan Dallaire - Nov 2025**

Magic gemstones are small pieces of magical energy that have solidified inside of rocks deep underground. Each type has a different colour and shape, and unlike normal gemstones, there is a faint glow that comes from the inside of the stone. A gemstone can be embedded into an object to allow someone to use its magic. This could be embedding it into the hilt of a sword (activates when you attack) or embedding it into the center of an amulet (can be used once per day), or even embedded into a ring (passive effect that is always active).   
Each magic gemstone is very valuable, some are so rare and powerful that even the rumour of one can cause a “gold-rush” to the area. Fake magic gems also get sold by scam artists.

## “Dead” Gems

Sometimes a magic effect is so powerful it fully drains the magic out of the gem. A gem that “dies” loses its colour and light and becomes a boring semi-transparent gray. Although myths of “recharging” dead gems circulate all the time, no one has actually proven a way to do so. Some people collect the “dead” gems on the off chance that someday it will be possible to recharge them. 

## Destroying a Magic Gemstone

Destroying a Gemstone unleashes a powerful torrent of magic. Usually it affects a large area. The act of destroying a gemstone can be done with some effort and a hammer.

## Gemborne Character

Extremely rare condition where a magic gem has formed inside a child as it grows in the womb. Has only ever happened when most of the pregnancy is spent underground, and has only been confirmed a few times.  
Gemborne characters have unusual abilities based around the gem that formed inside them. They also tend to be very secretive about the gem to avoid being killed to steal it.
