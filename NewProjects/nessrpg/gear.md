# Gear
**By Ryan Dallaire - Nov 2025**

## Sundries

Players can spend copper on generic Sundries. At 5 copper per Sundry. Each unit of Sundry can be used later to have up to 5 copper worth of mundane equipment at any time. This allows players to not have to pick out every piece of equipment they might need before leaving a settlement. This rule is optional and can be used to speed up visits to towns and trading ports.

## Mundane Equipment

Prices are in Copper pieces.  
1 Gold coin \= 10 Silver coins  \= 100 Copper coins.
