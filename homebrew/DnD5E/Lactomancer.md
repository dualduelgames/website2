# Lactomancer
{: .no_toc }

Inspired by Perf from JourneyQuest.
I created these rules for a character I was playing in a campaign. I only created the rules and spells I needed, so there isn't a lot of extra choices.

## School of Lactomancy (Wizard)

**Sustenance**  
2nd level \- You can survive on nothing but milk and milk products. You can also breath in any liquid that is mostly milk. You can also tell what creature produced the milk that you taste (either raw or as part of a milk product).  
**Mammalian presence**  
6th level \- Creatures that produce or consume milk treat you with reverence if they have an Int of 6 or less. You have advantage to animal handling, deception and persuasion checks against them. And always have the Create/Destroy Milk spell prepared if it is in your spellbook, it does not count as one of the spells you prepare each day.  
**Bovine Transposition**  
10th level \- As an action, you can replace any liquid within 5ft of you with milk. Or you can flavor any milk within 5ft of you to be plain, chocolate, strawberry, or coffee flavoured. You can use this ability on up to 3 gallons of liquid per day. You can also now flavour the milk you create with the Create/Destroy Milk spell.  
**Milk is life**  
14th level bonus \- Milk that you conjure acts as a healing potion. Anyone who drinks a serving regains 2d4 HP. A creature can only benefit from this effect once per long rest. And you can now cast the Water Walk spell on yourself without using a spell slot (once per long rest).

# Spell Descriptions
Spells are in alphabetical order.

## Bovine Intervention
{: .no_toc }
*2nd-level Lactomancy (Wizard)*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** VM  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a mammal or marsupial (with intelligence of 6 or less) you can see within range that can hear you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, etc ends the spell early.  
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.  
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a horse buck off the first person to try to ride it. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.  
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

The wall's space is difficult terrain. Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage, and fire damage is halved.
