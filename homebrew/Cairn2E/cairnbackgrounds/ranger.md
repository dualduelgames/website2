| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | **Forest/Jungle** - Studying a creature or plant for 1 hour allows you to gain basic knowledge about it, such as how dangerous it is, what uses it might have and what are its weaknesses. |
| **2** | **City** - Can track a humanoid as long as the tracks still exist and they aren’t being magically hidden.                                                                                  |
| **3** | **Fae Wild** - If in starlight, you can make light shine out of your hand. (As bright as a torch)                                                                                          |
| **4** | **Tundra** - You can reroll any save to avoid the effects of cold or windy weather. Must take the new result.                                                                              |
| **5** | **Coast** - You can swim and dive just as well as you can walk.                                                                                                                            |

## What do you find while wandering around? Roll 1d6:

|       |                        |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Albino Deer Pelt**   | You found a albino deer dying in a meadow. Its fur is comfortable enough to sleep on any surface and sitting on it makes riding a horse all day a breeze.         |
| **2** | **Elvish Cloak**       | Unusually light and superbly water-proof. Protects you from the wind and rain, even in the worst storms.                                                          |
| **3** | **Ocarina of Sleep**   | Playing this instrument can cause simple animals near you to fall asleep, even if they are aggressive. But make a WIS save to avoid falling asleep yourself.      |
| **4** | **The Silent Compass** | Instead of pointing north, it points toward the nearest sign of civilization in any lifeless landscape.                                                           |
| **5** | **Tranquil Pearl**     | When crushed in water, it calms a non-magical local tempest or storm. (1 use).                                                                                    |
| **6** | **Skullwart Shrooms**  | One of the most deadly known poisons. Consuming a pinch of dried mushroom kills in minutes. (2 uses).                                                             |
