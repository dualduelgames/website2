2. You pick an Ancestry which will modify your stats. You then get to add \+1 to two stats of your choice.  
3. You pick 2 abilities for your character, these can represent training you have received, natural talents, or even something intrinsic to your ancestry.

## Areas of Knowledge

A character might know everything there is to know about a particular subject. They allow you to roll to know about something related to that area of knowledge. Roll a Cleverness check vs the area TN. Having expertise in an area of knowledge also takes up one item slot in your inventory. This represents the tomes or scrolls you bring with you for reference.

But there are limits to the knowledge, such as knowing about the undead: they know about how they are made and their weaknesses but don’t know about specific things like where a certain necromancer has his hideout. Without an area of knowledge, a player can still make a roll to see what they know, but they will only know basic non-specific knowledge.
