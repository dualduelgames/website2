# Main Rules

Players play as hunters/gatherers trying to supply their tribe. The tribe requires their help to function and also consumes resources, but it gives them access to crafters and skills they don’t have, and a place to rest. They also fight off other tribes and dangerous beasts. There are also supernatural things like Magic Rituals.

## Stats & Skills

Stat bonuses are between 1 and 6\.  
VS another creature: Most actions involve rolling a D6 \+ a stat/skill bonus vs a creature's target number (TN).  
VS a target number:  you roll against a target number based on the difficulty of the task.

Some situations will change how likely you are to succeed:  
Disadvantage: Roll 2d6 and use the lowest.  
Advantage: Roll 2d6 and use the highest.

**Stats:**  
**Forceful**	Fight, Run, Climb  
Fight	Attacking a target or hunting  
Run	Long distance, or short sprinting  
Climb	Up rough surfaces, trees, etc

**Careful**	Dodge, Craft, Fire, Gather  
Dodge	Avoiding a danger  
Craft	Creating/building something  
Fire	Starting a fire  
Gather	Finding resources

**Mystical**	Stories, Rituals  
Stories	Recall the legends/history  
Rituals	Perform a magic ritual/sacrifice

## When to Roll

* There is a penalty for failure  
* Cannot be repeated infinitely

The situation should change whenever a roll happens. For better or worse.

{: .highlight }  
**Remember to “Let it Ride\!”**  
Don’t have the players reroll a check until something about the situation has changed.  
*They can’t roll again until they get a new tool, someone helps them, or they wait some time.*

## Target Numbers

The number you need to beat when you roll the dice is based on the difficulty of the task and any  situational bonus. Enemies have their target number.

**Easy		7**  
**Normal		9**  
**Tough		11**  
**Crazy		13**

## Resting

A rest takes 8 hours. A rest in a safe & warm area with enough food and water gets your full hp back and also resets your exposure level. Resting anywhere that isn’t warm and safe or without adequate supplies only restores 1d6 hp.

## Exposure

After a character spends 2 hours outside in cold weather, they get 1 level of Exposure. If a character is wearing warm furs, they get Exposure every 4 hours instead. Any character with 4 or more levels of exposure dies.

## Attacking

Attacks: Roll Forceful(Fight) vs their TN.  
Dodging: Roll Dodge(Careful) vs their TN.  
Armour decreases the damage from attacks.

## Equipment/Carrying Capacity

Each item takes up an item slot, except Resources(5 per slot). The number of slots you have is equal to your Forceful bonus \+ 3\.

**Durability**  
Objects can break through normal use. Their durability equals the total resources that were used to make it. After using an object during a play session, roll a d6:

* If your roll is equal to or below the object’s durability then nothing changes.  
* If your roll is above the object’s durability, it loses 1 durability.

An object with 0 durability left is broken and can no longer be used, Its resources are lost.

**Crafting & Repairing**  
Roll Craft vs a target number to craft or repair an object. An object can be repaired by spending a resource that is in the object’s recipe. 

**Reclaim**  
Resources can be reclaimed from an object that was crafted, allowing you to re-use them. The resources that can be reclaimed equals the object’s current durability.

## Resources

You collect resources from the environment, and then you can craft the items you need.  
Resources can be stacked into a single item slot, up to 5 of a resource per slot.  
Stone: Represents rocks that are good for smashing or flintknapping.   
Wood: Represents strong, straight branches.  
Water: Enough for 1 person for 1 day.  
Food: Can feed 1 person for 1 day.  
Furs: Represents material to cover something.  
Bone: Represents a bone that can be used as a replacement for wood in tools or as an ingredient for a ritual.  
Rope: Represents a few feet of cord/thread.

**Gathering/Hunting**  
1 roll per 2 hours spent gathering/hunting.  
Can be modified by the environment.  
Stone: 1d6-2 units of stone  
Wood: 1d6-1 units of wood  
Water: 1d6 units of water  
Food: 1d6-3 units of food  
Furs: 1d6-3 units of fur  
Bone: 1d6-4 units of bone  
Rope: 1 unit of rope

## Turn-based Rules

2 actions per turn. Possible actions: attack, move (30 ft), skill check, swap items, use an item.

## Initiative

Initiative is very simple. Either the players or  NPCs go first. Based on the circumstances.

## Your Tribe

The tribe does not have a hierarchy other than the older/wiser members being valued for their experience. Each member of the tribe needs at least 2 units of food and 2 of water per week from the players to survive. The other tribe members provide the rest of their own food. There is always a member of the tribe trained in any skill the players don’t have training in. One member of the tribe always knows the Heal Wounds ritual and is trained in the Rituals skill.
