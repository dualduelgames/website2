{:toc}

Players are members of an international spy organization. Trying to stop an evil organization, bent on world domination. It is rules-lite and uses player facing rolls. Based on a lasers & feelings style roll over/under system.  


# Player Rules

## Character Stats

Main Stat:  
There are 2 main stats and they are represented by a single number (between 2-9). A lower number means you are better at the Submachine Guns category and a higher number means you are better at the Subterfuge category.  
**Subterfuge**: Sneaking, Deceiving, Investigating, Sniping, Hacking, Lock Picking  
**Submachine Guns**: Action, Aggression, Being Bold, Explosives, Car Chases  
Health:  
Starts at 12, tracks how close you are to death.  
Armour:  
Based on your equipment, it decreases the damage you take.  
Experience Points:  
Tracks how much experience you have accumulated on your adventures. You can then spend the experience points to improve your character. (Track both Total and Spent)  
Skills:  
Characters have skill slots (start with 4\) that represent the extra skills they have based on their background. They can be filled in up front, or filled in as you play. They explain things like: I know all about… I am/was part of… I always carry my…  I hate…  
Each skill can be activated once per session until improved later. When activated they modify the difficulty of a task.

## When you do something

Roll a d10:  
Roll at or *above* stat number for **Submachine Guns**  
Roll at or *below* stat number for **Subterfuge**

Modifiers:  
Sometimes the situation will make a task more or less difficult. Your skills can also be used to prevent *Real Trouble* or create a *Piece of Cake*. You can also make things easier by getting help from another player. They have to justify how they are helping.  
**Real Trouble:** So difficult that you have to roll the dice twice and have to succeed on both rolls.  
**Piece of Cake:** So easy you get to roll twice and use either result. 

## Progression

As you complete missions, you gain experience as a super spy.  
Characters gain points of Experience (aka XP) and can spend it to:  
1 XP \- Change their stat number by \+/- 1  
2 XP \- Be issued a new piece of gear  
3 XP \- Max HP increased by 2  
4 XP \- Improve a skill (use it twice per session)  
5 XP \- Get another Skill “slot”

## Combat

You can do 2 of the following actions per turn:  
**Attack:** Roll either Subterfuge or Submachine Guns based on the situation. If you succeed you deal damage to the target. If they have armour then decrease the damage dealt by their armour value.  
**Dodge:** Prepare to dodge the next attack you receive. Roll based on the situation. If you succeed you dodge the attack and take no damage.  
**Move:** You move up to 6 meters. Less if the situation affects your movement.  
**Interact:** You can use, store, or remove an item.

### Damage Guide

| Poison | 2 Damage per Minute |
| :---- | :---- |
| Melee Attacks | 4 Damage |
| Bullets | 6 Damage |
| Explosions | 10 Damage |

## After Combat

**Reloading Guns:**  
If you used a gun during the last combat, you need to make a *Submachine Guns* roll. If you failed the roll you are out of ammo for it.  
**Healing Injuries:**  
If you took damage during the last combat, you can make a Subterfuge roll. If you succeed the roll you regain 4 HP.

## Gear

Each player character gets some basic gear: fancy clothes of your choice, a pistol with a silencer, and a spy watch. Ammo/batteries get replenished between missions.

## Lairs

Maps of evil lairs and spy bases. Secret volcano lair, Evil airship base, international spy hideout,   

## GM Skills

Ways for the GM to mix things up. Can be used when the players have activated their skills.  
**Weren't you counting?** A character suddenly finds their weapon is out of ammo.  
**Curse your inevitable betrayal\!** An NPC the players thought was on their side is discovered to be a double agent.  
**Stop, or my mom will shoot\!** A civilian the players are supposed to be protecting gets in on the action.  
**Surprise Attack\!** An enemy has snuck up on the players and they had no chance to detect them, but the first attack of the enemy barely misses its target.

## Special Abilities

Sometimes a character wants to use one of their backgrounds/skills to do something special. Instead of preventing *Real Trouble* or making a task a *Piece of Cake, they can try something special. Each background/skill can only be used like this once per session unless improved.*  
Examples:  
**Martial Arts background** \- (Judo Chop) When melee attacking someone who is unaware, you can knock them unconscious instead of dealing damage. (Grapple Master) Instead of dealing damage you can restrain your target.  
**Poison Training background** \- (Iron Stomach) Try to completely resist the effects of normal ingested poisons.  
**Gun Training background** \- (Sabotage) You can discreetly alter a gun to prevent it from functioning properly. You only need to have access to it for a moment. Roll Subterfuge to prevent someone from noticing your changes.
