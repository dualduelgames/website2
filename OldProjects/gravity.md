# Gravity Sliders
{: .no_toc }
**Version 0.1 - Sept 2019**
This is a hack of [Lasers & Feelings](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings).

1. TOC
{:toc}

Players are members of an international military organization that uses an alien device to travel to other planets. The device creates a wormhole in the floor that they can jump into to “slide” to another planet. It is similar to Stargate. It is rules-lite and uses player facing rolls. Based on a lasers & feelings style roll over/under system. It is meant for one-shot adventures and has limited character advancement.

# Player Rules

## Character Stats

There are 2 main stats and they are represented by a single number (between 2-9). A lower number means you are better at “Action” and a higher number means you are better at “Smarts”.  
**Smarts**: Sneaking, Deceiving, Investigating, Hacking, Technology  
**Action:** Aggression, Being Bold, Explosives, Chases, Shooting  
The only other stat you need to track is your Health (starts at 6).

## When you do something

Roll a d10:  
Roll at or *above* stat number for **Action**  
Roll at or *below* stat number for **Smarts**  
Real Trouble:  
so difficult that you have to roll the dice twice and have to succeed on both rolls.  
Piece of Cake:  
so prepared for a task that you get to roll twice and use either result.

## Skills

Characters have 4 Skill “slots” that give them extra skills based on their history. Background Skills can be filled up front, or can be filled in while playing. They explain things like: I know all about… I always carry my…  I hate…  
These background skills can prevent *Real Trouble* or can make a task a *Piece of Cake*. They can be activated once per session unless improved (use twice per session).

## Rewards

If you are playing a prolonged adventure, the GM will give out rewards as you progress through the story. Here are the different types of rewards:  
**Minor** \- Change their stat number  
**Minor** \- Be issued a new piece of gear  
**Major** \- Max HP increased by 2  
**Major** \- Improve a skill (use twice per session)  
**Major** \- Get another Skill “slot”

## Special Bonus

Each character gets to pick one of the following bonuses:  
**Alien** \- you are not human and can pick 1 extra piece of alien gear   
**Soldier** \- \+1 damage to all attacks  
**Scientist** \- Improve two of your skills  
**Specialist** \- gets 2 extra pieces of gear  
**Explorer** \- Extra improved skill: I will find my way  
**Medic** \- Start with a Med Kit, and you get 5 uses per kit

## Combat

Combat goes back and forth between the players & allies and enemies & environmental effects. On your turn you can take 1 action (and optionally a minor action) and then play moves on to the next character.

**Attacks:** Roll Action. If you succeed you deal damage to the target based on your weapon. If they have armour then decrease the damage dealt by 1\.

**Defending:** Roll based on the situation. If you succeed you dodge/block the attack and take no damage or effects.

### Action Guide

Major actions: When it is your turn, you can do one of the following actions:  
**Attack** \- Perform an attack against a target in range using a weapon.  
**Aid** \- Help someone else with a task they are performing. This cancels a “Real Trouble” or makes it a “Piece of Cake”. Need to justify how you are helping.  
**Use an item** \- Interact with an object in close range. Or reload a weapon.  
**Move** \- Move up to 7 meters. (but some environments slow you down)  
**Draw or Stow an item** \- From/to your bag/belt.  
Minor actions: are smaller actions that can be done while you perform a major action. You can perform one of the following on your turn:  
**Perceive** \- Roll Action  to spot threats, roll Smarts to spot clues.  
**Talk** \- Speak to characters. Roll Smarts if you are trying to deceive, persuade, etc.  
**Remember** \- Roll Smarts to try and recall something your character might know.

# GM Reference

### Planet Generator

The list below is the details the player team was given when they were recruited for the mission. Roll on the table 3 times (or choose).

The planet…
1. Has a stable climate  
2. Has intelligent indigenous life  
3. Has safe environment (acid rain, lava flow, etc)  
4. Has stable geology  
5. Isn’t controlled by the bad guys  
6. Has friendly Local fauna

### Mission Generator

Roll on the table below 3 times (or choose).

The mission…
1. Has been done before  
2. Shouldn't take long  
3. Requires only a few people  
4. Has no missing equipment  
5. Has no missing information  
6. Isn't time sensitive

### Fast-forward

If a combat or obstacle is trivial it should be skipped. The GM should narrate what happened and keep the story moving. For example, if the characters way out number an enemy and the fight is going to be boring. Or skip the roll for an action when there is no real penalty for failure, or there is no time pressure.

### GM Actions

Ways for the GM to mix things up. Each time a player uses a characters skill, you earn a point that can be used to trigger one of the following effects:  
**Weren't you counting?** A character suddenly finds their weapon is out of ammo. Or it malfunctioned.  
**Curse your inevitable betrayal\!** An NPC the players thought was on their side is discovered to be a double agent.  
**Stop, or my mom will shoot\!** A civilian the players are supposed to be protecting gets in on the action.  
**Surprise Attack\!** An enemy has snuck up on the players and they had no chance to detect them, but the first attack of the enemy barely misses its target.  
**Talk about luck.** An enemy attack hits a piece of gear instead of the character. That piece of gear is damaged and will have to be repaired.  
**I went to school too\!** An enemy uses a skill that they wouldn’t be expected to have.  
**How could there be a pyramid here?** A device/structure turns out to be an ancient alien device. It is almost magical because of how advanced it is.  
**Of course he’s here\!** A big baddie shows up just in time to taunt the players characters and escape.
